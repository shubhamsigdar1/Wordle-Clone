## Tech Used: ![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/badge/JAVASCRIPT-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=FFFFFF)

In this project, I Learn How to create the game board Dynamically by writing a JavaScript function and also How to Accept User Input in the right place or when the user key is pressed was Enter or Backspace, then go to the next line or delete one letter from the current row on the wordle board using javascript.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would Like to Remove Alert and showing ScoreBoard,and then Add dark mode and light mode Feature in it, and then add Local Storage i.e. If I close my browser and come back I can still start playing games where I last times stops to play.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that creating a successful project, isn't determined by it's complexity.
